# Daily--Work-Day-Scheduler

## Goal

To take the given starter code and use the jQuery API to build a fully interactive daily work scheduler. The over arching idea of this project was to test a new found skill in building a code base with jQuery and using the local storage set in the users web browser to store information for later use. The website is desgined to track the current time of the day and display an easy to understand Ui. The schedule will auto-matically color code itself depending on what time of day it is. If the time has past, the box will grey out. If it is the current hour, it will be displayed in red and any blocks that are set in the future will be displayed in green. 

## User Story

The given User Story is as follows:

    AS AN employee with a busy schedule
    I WANT to add important events to a daily planner
    SO THAT I can manage my time effectively

## Acceptance Criteria

    GIVEN I am using a daily planner to create a schedule
        WHEN I open the planner
        THEN the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
        WHEN I scroll down
        THEN I am presented with time blocks for standard business hours
        WHEN I view the time blocks for that day
        THEN each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
        WHEN I click into a time block
        THEN I can enter an event
        WHEN I click the save button for that time block
        THEN the text for that event is saved in local storage
        WHEN I refresh the page
        THEN the saved events persist
